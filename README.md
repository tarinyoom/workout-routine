# Workout Routine
This is just a compilation on a few thoughts I've had about working out. I am not a personal trainer, and not qualified in any way, so these are just some approaches that work well for _me_. Working out and exercising is a skill, just like anything else, and ultimately the best way to get better at it is to just do it a lot, but hopefully these notes can be helpful as an aid. 

# "What's your cooking routine"
If someone wanted to learn to cook delicious food, what advice would you give them? You could certainly give them a "routine" of recipes to make, and that's certainly a helpful starting point. But if the recipe calls for you to dice an onion, or separate an egg, then your success in cooking the dish really depends on how well you can do those things, which are most likely not included in the recipe. And your success as a cook overall probably doesn't just depend on a given recipe specifically, it depends on other things, like how you choose produce, what dishes you choose to cook based on the produce available, etc. 

So when it comes to working out, the "recipe" isn't that important - if you search for "beginner workout routines", you'll find a lot of wonderful resources to use. What's more important in my view are learning how to focus on the technique when approaching an exercise, and the general philosophy on how to approach exercise and health.

## The Recipes
I focus heavily on compound movements. The lower body movements I focus on are
[squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oed-UmAxFs) and [reverse lunges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjlsISvHyZs), and the upper body movements I focus on are [lat pull-downs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAwf7n6Luuc) and [push-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxhNoKZlfY8). Note that reverse lunges and push-ups can be done entirely at home (you don't really _need_ dumbbells to do reverse lunges), so those two exercises are my go-tos when I'm at a place with no accessible gym.

The reason I focus on compound movements are that they're easier to execute, and also engage your muscles much more efficiently with respect to time. You can get a great workout by literally doing nothing but these four movements!

## The Technique: Light and controlled
When you're doing an exercise, go light. I usually aim for somewhere in the 6- to 12- rep range, which works well to get me tired. Just for perspective, I consider myself a fairly fit person, and in almost every exercise I do involve a machine, I find myself using a weight somewhere in the lightest 25% of its settings. The weights aren't a goal, they're a tool to achieve your goal of health, so don't get fooled into the "how heavy can I lift?" mentality - it's a lot more useful to think of it as "how light of a weight can I use while still getting an effective workout?". The answer to that question is often, "pretty light". 

Since I have limited time at the gym, I try to keep my workouts short and focused. When doing a movement, I try to visualize the muscles engaged ([these diagrams](https://parallelcoaching.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lat-Pull-Down-Technique-How-to-correct-a-client.jpg) are very helpful to me), and in between sets, I stay off my phone and focus on visualizing the next movement I'm going to do. As a result, I can get a pretty good workout in in 30-50 minutes, which is something that's important to me. 

## The Philosophy: Flexibility
Everyone has different time availabilities when it comes to exercise, and for a given person, your enthusiasm and energy may vary greatly on a day-to-day basis. So a critical task for you is to design a lifestyle that meshes well with your schedule and goals, and also tolerant to changes in your motivation level. If you live far away from the gym, you should find some exercise to do that doesn't involve driving all the way to the gym, so that if you're feeling down one day, you can still get a work out in. And if you show up to the gym and feel tired, you should try to look for exercises that aren't as taxing, or just do some cardio. This is a highly exploratory process, and finding a workout that suits your exact lifestyle and propensities is a task that you can devote your entire life towards (some people do). 

Some helpful options that can increase the flexibility of your routine:
 - Learn some at-home movements that are effective for you, e.g. reverse lunges, push-ups, running
 - Find exercise methods that are conveniently located and that you enjoy
 - Limit the time devoted to your workouts to an amount that doesn't feel like a major undertaking

So start by learning those compound movements one at a time, and seeing how each makes you feel. Try to incorporate them into your life according to your availability, and see how well you can mesh them into your life. 

# Good Luck
It sounds trite to say, but ultimately, you do have to find your own path. Health and exercise are such motivation-based pursuits, that more than anything, you need to find something that works well for you and meshes cleanly with your life. In terms of the actual technical difficulty or chemical energy needed to work out, the requirement isn't that high. So the big task isn't really to figure out "how to exercise" - it's "how to integrate exercise into your life".
